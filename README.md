# Pinephone screen protector

A set of designs of screen and camera protectors for the Pinephone.

Some places do offer cutting out custom screen protectors for phones -
you can use this design to cover whole flat area of the screen.
I used the design for a privacy filter.

## Screen protector
The principal dimensions of flat area are 155 by 71 mm. Corner radius is 8mm. Cutout radius is 4mmm.

It comes in 3 varieties:
- [Translucent](screen_protector_translucent.svg) - with cutout only for speaker, for use with glass or fully translucent film only,
  otherwise will cause issues with camera and proximity sensor.
- [Filter](screen_protector_filter.svg) - for privacy filters or matte film/glass, with cutouts for camera and proximity sensor,
  which would otherwise be obstructed by the film, preventing their correct operation.
- [Notch](screen_protector_notch.svg) - the same, but with one big, symmetrical cutout to accomodate the above,
  if you prefer more exposed area for aesthetic reasons.

## Rear camera protector
Principal dimensions are 20 by 8 mm, with fully rounded ends - radius is 4mm.

It is recommended to cut more than one protector at once, as they are tiny, and to avoid wasting material.
When ordering screen protector made from translucent material, this can be cut from the same sheet.
